Level-9 Games Website

Since I was a little kid, I’ve had a love for video games. Now I’m old enough that the games I played in the 90’s and early 00’s are now considered retro or classic. What I would like to propose is a website for a fictitious classic games store called Level-9 Games. This store buys and sells used classic video game systems and games. (Possibly trading card games and board games as well – this is subject to change). While modern in function, this website will have the aesthetic of what the Internet and OS’s looked like back in the late 1990’s early 2000’s (Frutiger Aero/Web 2.0 Gloss).

* Users will be able to search through the available items on the websites and add them to a shopping cart. 
    * Ability to search through different categories of Consoles/games (I.E. ‘games made by Nintendo’ or ‘Sony Play Station Consoles’)
    * They will also be able to submit information about their own games/consoles that they would like to have sold through the website
        * Separate page where they can see their own submitted items
*	Employee login where they will have access to add/remove items from the website and edit their prices and photos.
*	Frutiger Aero/Web 2.0 Gloss aesthetic
